# Challenge: Implementing DevOps Practices in a Fictional Business Environment

## 🚀 Introduction

In this Rocketseat challenge, I simulated the implementation of DevOps practices in a fictional business environment. I used the **CALMS** concepts and the **Three Ways of DevOps** to identify opportunities, improve existing processes, and propose solutions that foster a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous learning.

## 🔍 Diagnosis and Implementation

Below is the analysis and the proposed solutions based on the CALMS framework and the Three Ways.

### 🧭 1. Cultural Diagnosis (The "C" in CALMS)

#### Current Deploy

* **Problem:** The deploy is done manually in the production environment.
* **Symptom:** It doesn't follow a standardized procedure and doesn't use automation.
* **Result:** 😥 Friction between teams, as the production deploy is done without a defined standard.

#### 💡 Improvement Opportunity

* **Solution:** Implement **automation** for the deploy process.

---

### 🤖 2. Automation (The "A" in CALMS)

* **Tool:** Using **Github Pages** to automate the deploy.
* **Process:**
    1.  The team pushes the code to the repository.
    2.  The repository owner changes the branch's deploy to **Github Actions** (in "Settings").

### 📊📈 3. Measurement and Sharing (The "M" and "S" in CALMS)

* **Measurement (M):** 🚀 We achieved **over 30% greater efficiency** compared to previous results with deploy optimization.
* **Sharing (S):** 🤝 With each new implementation, the person responsible shares their knowledge with the rest of the team, always with **humility and kindness**.

### 🛣️ 4. Applying The Three Ways

#### 1️⃣ The First Way: Accelerate the Flow

* 💨 Automated deploys via **Github Pages**.
* ✅ Automated tests to ensure quality.

#### 2️⃣ The Second Way: Amplify Feedback

* 🔄 **Code Reviews** with constructive comments.
* ⚙️ Automated tests that provide fast feedback.
* 🗣️ Agile rituals like **Daily Scrum** and **Sprint Review**.

#### 3️⃣ The Third Way: Experiment and Learn

* 🌱 **Continuous feedback** for constant improvement.
* 🧠 Constant knowledge sharing within the team.
* 📚 Courses offered by the company and support from more experienced professionals.
* 🧘 **Normalizing failures:** Understanding that failures are
